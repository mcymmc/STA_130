    "The key factor that decides whether a hypothesis can or cannot be tested is whether there are stats or evidence already existing that can be used for observations and measurements. The video uses the example of comparing two former presidents who have evidence and data of their time in office vs two candidates who don't have time in office and therefore cannot be compared statistically on who is the better president.\n",

    "We need to remember that when we measure a sample of data, we take the $x_i\\!$s (data points) to come up with a $\\bar x$ (mean of the data points) to make conclusions about the entire population. We're not just calculating the $\\bar x$ to know the average of the sample, but we're trying to reach an estimate of the $\\mu$ (mean of the population). By calculating the $\\mu$, we can see how far it is from $\\mu_0$ (which is the value of the population mean that we're testing). If $\\mu$ is far from $\\mu_0$, it suggest that the true population mean might not be the tested population mean. We cannot just use $\\bar x$ to compare it to the $\\mu_0$ because the average of one sample is not enough. we need multiple $\\bar x$s from multiple samples to reach a good estimate for $\\mu$, which we can then use to compare to $\\mu_0$.\n",

    "So we have to imagine a world where the null hypothesis is true right? In this world, where the null hypothesis is true. Now in this world, you will have to imagine what could happen that would make the null hypothesis true. And based on those things that would happen (aka the data and stats in this world), you can calculate how probable any of that is to happen. That calculation is the p-value. The p-value essentially represents how probable our null hypothesis is to being true. The lower the p value, less probable the null hypothesis is to be true, and the higher the p value, the more probable the null hypothesis is true."

    "So I conducted 124 coin flips, with 66 heads and 58 tails. They are quite close to being 50/50. ChatGPT calculated that 66 heads is roughly 53.2% of 124. So now we calculate the p value to get 0.00078. The p value is less or equal to 0.001 which strongly suggests that the evidence collected goes against the null hypothesis, which is that head tilting is random). I only did the 124 coin flip test once, but if we want a more accurate number, we can run the test multiple times, although I dont think the p value will increase enough such that the evidence will suggest anythign different.\n",
